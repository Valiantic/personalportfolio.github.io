Every School Vacation i've always used my spare time in Studying things that is aligned with my field of expertise and course. 
so using the knowledge i've acquire in my senior highschool days i created a personal website using html and css mix with a tiny 
bit javascript to showcase my projects in the past. it also present my other skill and the historical background i have.
